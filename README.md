This repo is eliminated some valuable part like runnning trading bot part.

## Overview

It provides methods for creating, trading, and removing liquidity of the pool when it meets certain level of liquidity.

## Brief Explanation

You can check the sample token in this. [link](https://dexscreener.com/solana/8ko7PyzzG8RZUXhHhahfsFE2g1tnCkPWddEBXrmKs42X)

But this token is tested with very small liquidity, so didn't make good profit.

But it is very profitable when you try it with a little big amount.

I hope this can be helpful for you and can help you with my good experience in development of Solana Trading bots.
